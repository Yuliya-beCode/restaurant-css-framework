 ## By creating the website, the following coding languages have been used

 1. html
 2. css
 3. bootstrap (the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites)


    The website is considered to be responsive, at least for small and medium screens. 


    The website consists of five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and contact.
    
Welcome

- A page with one Jumbotron and two panels to show news (promo, events, etc…​).
Menu

- A page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.
Pictures

- A page with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per page).
Restaurant

- A page about the restaurants (it’s a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and different schedules.

- Contact

    A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message itself and a send button with an icon. Each entry as a title in a semantically correct tag.


## At the first stage, I created my design in Figma.
